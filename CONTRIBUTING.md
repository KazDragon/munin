# How to Contribute to Munin

## General

Contributions are welcome!

## Scope

Munin is a C++-14 library aimed at providing an component-based UI widget library to help development of high-quality, terminal-based user interfaces.

## Contributing

Contributions can be in several forms:
* Opening issues - the simplest way of contributing can be to say how you would like to use the library.  Or, alternatively, what you couldn't work out from the documentation.  Every ticket closed ends up improving the library!
* Providing fixes - any size welcome.  Spotted a typo?  You can edit this online and submit a pull request.  Have a complete new feature you want to develop and integrate?  Awesome!  You can fork the repo, develop on a branch, and then submit that as a pull request.

## Guidelines

This is a C++-14 codebase, with a Standard Library/Boost look-and-feel.  Please let your tests drive your development, and keep it to around 80 characters per line to make it easier to read.  The rest is negotiable during integration.
